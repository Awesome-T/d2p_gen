## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Awesome-T/arb_gen project, please let us know by sending an email to [hereiscreativecode@gmail.com](mailto:hereiscreativecode@gmail.com). We'll address the issue promptly and keep you updated throughout the resolution process.

Please provide us with detailed information about the vulnerability so we can reproduce and validate it. Include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any other relevant details.

## Supported Versions

We prioritize fixing security vulnerabilities in the latest release of the project. If the vulnerability exists in an older version, we'll assess the severity and decide whether to address it.

## Disclosure Policy

We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days and will work diligently to address it as soon as possible. We'll keep you informed of our progress and will release a fix as soon as it's ready.

While we're investigating and resolving the vulnerability, we kindly request that you refrain from disclosing it publicly or to any other parties.

## Vulnerability Severity

We use the [CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)](https://www.first.org/cvss/) to assess the severity of reported vulnerabilities. We'll assign a severity score based on the impact and exploitability of the vulnerability.
